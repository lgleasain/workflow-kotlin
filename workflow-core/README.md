# Module workflow-core

This module contains the core workflow APIs.

## Notes on Dispatchers

_Dispatchers control what threads/pools coroutines are run on. [See here for more information.][1]_

Most workflow code will default to, or force, the use of the `Unconfined` dispatcher. The reason for
this is that the workflow code itself is side-effect-free and doesn't care what dispatcher it runs
on, so using the `Unconfined` dispatcher eliminates the overhead of having to actually dispatch
anything unnecessarily. When required, your code can use `withContext` to use a different
dispatcher. For example, if a workflow is making a network call, it should wrap the call in
`withContext(IO)`.
